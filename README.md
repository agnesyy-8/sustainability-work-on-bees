# sustainability-work-on-bees
Our question of research was “Halt the loss of biodiversity”, which is one of the UN’s SDGs. We started the work by identifying the problems of biodiversity and how we can participate in reducing this issue digitally. In the beginning of research we found out that most of solutions posted on the web are NGOs raising funds for certain initiations done in person.
We wanted to come up with innovative solution addressing this issue head on.

We discovered that bees are pollinators that support the growth of trees, flowers, and other plants. This means they play a huge role in the continuation of biodiversity.

Thus, we wanted to create something accessible for beekeepers to encourage them to keep on taking care of bees and to improve the quality of bees’ life.
We created an app (using figma) and a html.website to introduce it.
